    "In this lesson, we will look at how **Variance** of a random variable is used to calculate **Covariance** and **Correlation**, two key measures used in statistics for finding the relationships between random variables. These measures help us identify the degree to which two sets of data tend to deviate from their expected value (i.e. mean), in a similar way.  Based on these measures, we can see if two variables move together, and to what extent.  This lesson will help you develop a conceptual understanding, necessary calculations, and some precautions to keep in mind when using these measures. "

    "Before we talk about covariance, we should get some idea around **Variance** of a random variable. Variance refers to the __spread of a variable in a dataset__.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Variance is a measure used to quantify how much a random variable deviates from its mean value__. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate variance, we are essentially asking, \"__Given the relationship of all given data points, how distant from the mean do we expect the next data point to be?__\"  This \"distance\" is called the **error term**, and it's what variance measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variance is shown using notation $\\sigma^2$. Previously, we have seen $\\sigma$ as a measure of standard deviation. Remember, standard deviation is also a measure of the spread of data. __Variance is simply the square of standard deviation (Or we could say standard deviation is the square root of variance)__. "

    "For example, a simple application of this measure could be associating probabilities with predicted future events in a market research activity, identifying them as \"very likely\" or \"unlikely\" etc. Most people are risk averse, in that they wish to minimize the amount of risk they must endure to earn a certain level of expected return. If investors were indifferent to risk, they would not be influenced by the differences between stock A and stock B above, whereas the risk-averse investor would clearly prefer stock A. Therefore, most people want to know the range or dispersion(spread/deviation as we termed it earlier) of possible outcomes, as well as the likelihood of certain outcomes occurring. Variance measure is a great way to find all of the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range defined by the underlying data. \n",

    "Conglomo's distribution of returns is more concentrated than Bilco's, as illustrated by Conglomo's relatively wider bell curve. A more concentrated distribution is defined as having a smaller standard deviation. The distribution curve appears higher, steeper, and narrower because more observations are occurring close to the expected return. Bilco's distribution is rather flat, reflecting that its returns are less concentrated, or more dispersed, than those of Conglomo Inc."
